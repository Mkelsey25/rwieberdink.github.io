            <p class="p1">Welcome! My name is Rebecca Wieberdink, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer and a certified science and math teacher. I earned a Bachelor's of Science in Education at Augusta University, and I graduate from Georgia Tech in October 2018 with a certification in web development. I am internationally certified in teaching English and grammar and have had the opportunity to teach speakers of other languages from 46 different countries. I am excited to combine my love of lexical analysis and algebraic thinking to build websites and applications that provide a riveting user interface (UI), effective functionality, and a meaningful purpose to individuals or a community.</p> 
            <br>
            <p class="p1">Through my training in front-end technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Media Queries, JavaScript, jQuery, and Moment.js, I aim to provide optimal usability and responsive designs. I am sufficient in data analysis and dynamic web development through the use of server-side technologies, database software, and ORM's, including MongoDB and Mongoose, MySQL and Sequelize, Express.js, React.js, Handlebars.js, and Node.js.</p>
            <br>  
            <p class="p1">Designing and developing websites and applications has proven to be challenging and motivating. I will continue to learn and code each day and provide useful and purposeful content to my clients.</p>
